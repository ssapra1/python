## Introduction

This project showcases a Python-based application that uses some powerful libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, and more to perform computational and data-driven operations. This code provides a foundation for machine learning, data analysis, and image processing tasks.

---

## Features

- **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: Powered by **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- **Machine Learning**: Using **Scikit-Learn** for classification, clustering, and more.
- **Image Processing**: Utilized via the **Pillow** library.
- **Network Requests**: Simplified with the **Requests** library.
- **Web Applications**: Integrated support for real-time communication using **Tornado**.
- **Custom Template Rendering**: Managed seamlessly with **Jinja2**.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the project by running the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the entry point of your application. Any required instructions on using specific modules within the project should be added here.

---

## Running the Tests

Tests can be added to ensure that the functionality of the application works as intended. You can use **unittest** or **pytest** for this purpose. To execute the tests:

Using `unittest`:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

Using `pytest`:
```bash
pytest
```

Test files should be placed in a `tests` folder following Python's naming convention (e.g., `test_<module>.py`).
